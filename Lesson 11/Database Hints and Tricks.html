     <p>The last lesson focused on getting data into and out of a database. Now we'll go over some
          different techniques that make it more convenient to use our data, by treating 
         relational data just like other data in our programs. We already learned that after creating a 
         cursor from a database connection, we pass SQL to 
         the cursor's <span class="darkgreen">execute()</span> method. If the SQL statements produce data, we 
         call an additional cursor method to retrieve the data. Most database cursors have three methods to 
         retrieve data from the query results. Each data row is a tuple containing an element for each column 
         in the query's result. </p>
        
   <div class="c"> <table class="tbl"><tbody><tr><th>Method&nbsp;Name</th><th>Functionality</th></tr><tr><td>fetchone()</td><td>Returns the next database row from the result set. If no rows are left, it returns 
                 <b>None</b>.</td></tr><tr><td>fetchmany(<i>n</i>)</td><td>Returns a list of up to <i>n</i> rows. If the 
                 result set is exhausted, it returns an empty list.</td></tr><tr><td>fetchall()</td><td>Returns a list of all rows remaining in the result set.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

      <p>While you can deal with the data as tuples, it's not always the most convenient technique. The 
          issue with tuples is that you need to use a numeric index to retrieve elements. This can make your code 
          unreadable, as this first coding exercise will show. Create a <b>DatabaseHints</b> project and 
          assign it to your <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set. Then, copy your <b>database.py</b> from 
          <b>HandlingDatabases/src</b> to <b>DatabaseHints/src</b> to make your login information available 
          to programs in this lesson's folder. Create <b>datatest.py</b> in the <b>DatabaseHints/src</b>

      <p>The code uses a cursor's <span class="darkgreen">execute()</span> method to request all animal data, and 
          then iterates over the list of tuples returned by the cursor's <span class="darkgreen">fetchall()</span> 
          method. But looking at the last line of the code, it isn't at all obvious that 
          <b>animal[1]</b> is the animal's name, <b>animal[3]</b> is its weight, and <b>animal[2]</b> 
          represents the animal family. Since you know that readability is one of the most important aspects 
          of code, it would be good to allow access to data elements by name. We can do that using 
          various Python features.</p>

      <p>One way to do it that will immediately improve the readability of our code, is to use an unpacking 
          assignment in the <b>for</b> loop that iterates over the result set. At the same time, we'll 
          change the SQL to explicitly retrieve only the fields we want. Each element of the (three-element) 
          tuple is stored in its own variable, thanks to the unpacking assignment. This makes the code 
          a bit easier to read, but it does not effect its result at all. This updated version of the code 
          should produce exactly the same output. In <b>datatest.py</b>, type the code below as shown: </p>

      <p>Another way to make the code more comprehensible is to create an object for each row that has 
          attributes with the same names as the columns, to hold the data elements retrieved from the 
          database. Then we'll begin to see that the rows returned from a query are actually data objects. In

      <p>The program now defines the representation of an <b>Animal</b> by implementing a 
          <span class="darkgreen">__repr__()</span> method for Animal. The <span class="darkblue">animals</span> list is 
          created in a list comprehension that provides individual arguments to the Animal creation using 
          Python's "<span class="blue">*</span>" feature. As we learned earlier, Python's "<span class="blue">*</span>" feature 
          takes a tuple or list and turns it 
          into a series of individual arguments, as required by the Animal class's 
          <span class="darkred">__init__()</span> method. The <span class="purple">pprint()</span> function, imported from the 
          <span class="green">pprint</span> module, displays the representation of each list element by calling the 
          <span class="darkgreen">__repr__()</span> method.</p>

      <p>This test isn't perfect, but it does cover most basic functionality. 
          A silently-passing test is usually better. (Can you think of a way to silence the testing? Consider 
          the <span class="darkgreen">exec()</span> function). The test code also shows you one way to create 
          an instance of this class from a row in a database table. Keep in mind that this method depends on 
          the precise order of 
          the fields in the database table, which isn't always a given. Someone might change 
          the structure of the database without your knowledge, which could cause problems.</p>

      <p>You can go further by defining a function that returns a tailored class, of which you can create 
          instances to represent each row. To create the class, you would call:</p> 
          
      <p><b>RC = RecordClass("animal", "id name family weight")</b></p> 
      
      <p>Once you create the class, you would create instances of that class by calling the class with 
          values for each of the named columns as follows:</p> 
                
      <p><b> for row in cursor.fetchall(): row_record = RC(*row)</b></p>
            
      <p>You have the power to go in many different directions with Python objects. As a relative 
          newcomer to the programming scene, you might sometimes find yourself almost paralyzed by the 
          limitless number of options you have. Don't panic. In almost every case, the best way to deal with the 
          quandary is to go ahead and write something. If it needs to be changed later, that's fine—your tests 
          should save you from big mistakes.</p>
         
      <p> Going further, you'll consider the best way to create the Animal objects, and which 
          methods they should have. And what kind of objects should those methods to return? It 
          seems like it would be a good idea to have <span class="darkgreen">read()</span> return an Animal instance, but is it
          appropriate for a method of Animal to return an animal? And what arguments should 
          <span class="darkgreen">read()</span> be capable of accepting?</p> 
            
      <p>Should <span class="darkgreen">readAnimal()</span> be a function instead of an Animal method? How 
          about <span class="darkgreen">write()</span>? Or should that be <span class="darkgreen">save()</span>? Is there any 
          really important value for that method to return? Maybe the names of the written fields? </p>

      <p>Of course, you don't always want every column of every row. Suppose you only wanted to retrieve 
          certain columns; would it help to keep the names of those columns somewhere, and build the column 
          names into the query somehow? That way you could have queries that didn't bring unnecessary data 
          into memory, for example. This is not only possible, it's what we're going to do next!</p>

  <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Manipulating SQL in Python</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>Python objects have a defined life-cycle which generally begins by calling the type's 
          <span class="darkgreen">__new__()</span> method, then calling the <span class="darkgreen">__init__()</span> method 
          of the "instance" returned by that. But most objects' behavior is determined by the methods you 
          write. You can write their <span class="darkgreen">__new__(</span>) and <span class="darkgreen">__init__()</span> 
          methods if you like. Once you know what you're doing, you can pretty much install your own 
          logic and have objects behave according to your plan. </p>

      <p>So, how would you like a query to behave? Do you want your query to be on just a single table? 
          If not, you will need to generate <i>JOINs</i>—if there are <i>n</i> tables, there must be 
          <i>n</i>-1 JOIN conditions. Do you want to be able to determine which columns from which of the 
          joined tables should be read in, and updated when written? Do you want to be able to read and 
          write those objects, at least by primary key? </p>
            
      <p>There are some generic solutions to these problems, but those frameworks can be intimidating at first.
           With your knowledge of Python, you already understand 
          some techniques that make the database data easier to handle. It's good to have a range of 
          techniques at your command for different situations. In order to implement those techniques, you'll need to 
          understand how Python can be used to create SQL statements. Check it out:</p>
            
      

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Generic SQL SELECT Query</div><div class="observe"><pre>SELECT <span class="darkblue">column</span>, ... FROM <span class="darkred">relation</span> WHERE conditions
</pre></div></div>

      <p>The <span class="darkred">relation</span> being queried is often a <b>table</b>, though you can query a <b>join</b> as well. 
          The <span class="darkblue">column</span> list in the statement may consist of simple column names or qualified names. 
          If two or more of the tables in a query possess columns with the same name, these columns can only 
          be referred to using <i>tablename.columname</i> syntax. You don't necessarily need all columns of 
          a table each time you reference a row, so you can make a case for having several different object 
          types for a given table, each using a different set of columns. </p>

      <a href="" name="question1"></a><p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Using only a subset of the columns of a table can be taken to its logical extreme by actually 
          splitting the columns across multiple tables, of "commonly used" and "less commonly used" columns. 
          The technical name for this is <i>vertical partitioning</i>. What do you imagine a 
          <i>horizontal partitioning</i> might do? (<a href="http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Python2/DatabaseHintsAndTricks.html#answer1">Answer at bottom</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table></p>

      <p>Suppose <span class="darkgreen">cols</span> is the list of column names you want, <span class="orange">table</span> is 
          the name of the table, and there are no other conditions on the data. The SQL statement you'd need to 
          start with is:</p>

      <p>"SELECT {0} FROM {1}".format(", ".join( <span class="darkgreen">cols</span> ), <span class="orange">table</span>)</p>

      <p>The rows returned by this query have len(<span class="darkgreen">cols</span>) elements, and the name of 
          column <i>n</i> is <span class="darkgreen">cols</span>[<i>n</i>]. </p>

      <p>In this next example, you'll generate the SQL from its component parts, and have 
          a chance to observe how queries can be built. Type the code below into an interactive interpreter session, as shown:</p>
      
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>cols = "id name family".split()</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>", ".join(cols)</ins>
'id, name, family'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>table = "animal"</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>"SELECT {0} FROM {1}".format(", ".join(cols), table)</ins>
'SELECT id, name, family FROM animal'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>condition1 = "id=7"</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>conditions = [condition1]</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>" AND ".join(conditions)</ins>
'id=7'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>conditions.append("family IS NOT NULL")</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>" AND ".join(conditions)</ins>
'id=7 AND family IS NOT NULL'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>"SELECT {0} FROM {1} WHERE {2}".format(</ins>
... <ins>", ".join(cols), table, " AND ".join(conditions))</ins>
'SELECT id, name, family FROM animal WHERE id=7 AND family IS NOT NULL'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre></div></div>

      <p>Let's take a closer look at that last statement:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: SELECT Statement Building</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="green">"SELECT <span class="darkred">{0}</span> FROM <span class="darkblue">{1}</span> WHERE <span class="purple">{2}</span>"</span>.format(<span class="darkred">", ".join(cols)</span>, <span class="darkblue">table</span>, <span class="purple">" AND ".join(conditions)</span>) 
</pre></div></div>

      <p>The result of this expression is:</p>

      <p>'<span class="green">SELECT</span>
                <span class="darkred">id, name, family</span>
                <span class="green">FROM</span>
                <span class="darkblue">animal</span>
                <span class="green">WHERE</span>
                <span class="purple">id=7 AND family IS NOT NULL</span>'</p>

      <p>When a query joins multiple tables, there is always a chance that a name conflict will 
          occur—the same column name might be defined in multiple tables. If you have enough 
          information about the database, you can predict and avoid such conflicts by 
          using the fully-qualified name <i>table.column</i>. The SQL interpreter will tell you when you 
          make mistakes like this.</p>

      <p>Let's say you have the column names and corresponding data items in lists. You can create a Python 
          object for each of the rows retrieved with attributes of the same names as the columns (the column 
          names must be named in acceptable Python style for the scheme to work properly). Earlier, we 
          looked at how attribute assignment works on Python objects. Don't worry if your memory is a bit fuzzy on this. 
          Just 
          focus on this part: if <i>x</i> is some Python object, then the assignment <b><i>x</i>.name = 
              value</b> is pretty much equivalent to <b><i>x</i>.__dict__['name'] = value</b>, which can also
          be expressed as <b>setattr(<i>x</i>, 'name', value)</b>.</p>

      <p>Now, suppose the column names are "id," "name," and "email," and 
          that you have a (three-element) data row holding a value for each attribute. There are various ways 
          to modify a Python object. The object must be an instance of some user-defined class though, 
          because built-in classes like <b>int</b> and <b>list</b> use a different mechanism to look 
          up attributes. Type the code below as shown into an interactive interpreter console: 
           </p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>COLS = "id name email".split()</ins>

&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r1.id, r1.name, r1.email</ins>

&gt;&gt;&gt;            
</pre></div></div>

      <p>So now you know how to inject arbitrary attributes into a Python object. 
          Writing three lines of code to create the object you want is pretty economical. But when the <b>__dict__</b> attribute 
          is actually a standard Python dict, it has an <span class="darkgreen">update()</span> method, which you can call with either a 
          dict or a sequence of (key, value) pairs as its sole argument. The arguments are added to the 
          original dict, overwriting the values of existing keys and adding new ones as necessary. This means 
          you can achieve the same result even more efficiently. 
          Continue your previous interactive session, typing the code below as shown: </p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>zip(COLS, data)</ins>
&lt;zip object at 0x0116F738&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>dict(zip(COLS, data))</ins>
{'email': 'steve@holdenweb.com', 'id': 1, 'name': 'Steve Holden'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r2 = row()</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r2.__dict__.update(dict(zip(COLS, data)))</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r2.email</ins>
'steve@holdenweb.com'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>dir(r2)</ins>
['__doc__', '__module__', ... 'email', 'id', 'name']
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r3 = row()</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>r3.__dict__.update(zip(COLS, data))</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>dir(r3)</ins>
['__doc__', '__module__', ... 'email', 'id', 'name']&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div></div>

      <p>As the <b>r3</b> example above demonstrates, the <span class="darkgreen">dict.update()</span> 
          method also accepts a sequence of (name, value) tuples as an 
          argument, avoiding the unnecessary creation of a dict. This type of manipulation is common in 
          some applications.</p>

      <p>Armed with this knowledge, you can now write a class with a constructor call that takes the column names 
          and data items as arguments, and returns an object with the attributes set. Keep in mind that 
          database column names do not always follow exactly the same rules as Python names, so 
          you might find tables that don't adapt well to this technique. There are often remedies 
          you can apply at the database level to compensate for poor naming choices, 
          but that topic is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

datarow.py : implements a simple database record class
"""

class row:
    def __init__(self, cols, data):
        self.__dict__.update(zip(cols, data))
    def __repr__(self):
        return "user_record(id={0.id} name={0.name} email={0.email})".format(self)
        
if __name__ == "__main__": # Simple self-test
    r1 = row(['id', 'name', 'email'],
             (1, "Steve Holden", "steve@holdenweb.com"))
    if r1.id != 1 or r1.name != "Steve Holden" or r1.email != "steve@holdenweb.com":
        print("TEST FAILED: id={0.id} name={0.name} email={0.email}".format(r1))</ins>
</pre></div></div>

      <p>The test code demonstrates a feature of the string <span class="darkgreen">.format()</span> method. 
          You can see that it 
          is not difficult to access the named attributes of the format arguments (which are 
          themselves addressed by number). 
          So, rather than passing three arguments to <span class="darkgreen">format()</span>, you just 
          pass one, and select the fields inside the format. If we had used this ability in the <b>animal.py</b> 
          example earlier, we could have replaced this:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Original __repr__() method for Animal class</div><div class="observe"><pre>def __repr__(self):
    return "Animal({0}, '{1}', '{2}', {3})".format(
            self.id, self.name, self.family, self.weight)
</pre></div></div>

      <p>with the slightly more readable:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Revised __repr__()method for Animal class</div><div class="observe"><pre>def __repr__(self):
    return "Animal({0.id!r}, {0.name!r}, {0.family!r}, {0.weight!r})".format(self)
</pre></div></div>

      <p>The <b>!r</b> at the end of each format specification tells the interpreter to substitute the 
          object's <b>repr()</b> representation. (That's why strings will still be displayed with quotation 
          marks around them, even though none appear in the format). </p>

      <p>The row class developed in the preceding section works well enough, but the column names have to be 
          passed in every time you create a new object. It would be more convenient to create a class with 
          the column names already incorporated. You can do this by constructing the class inside a function,
          which takes the column and the table names as arguments. The function then returns the class after 
          inserting the table name and the column names as class attributes. The function effectively becomes 
          a "class factory," returning a slightly different class each time it is called. </p>
            
      <p>We'll write some basic tests for the function we're going to create—this will allow us to 
         to verify its operation. In the <b>DatabaseHints/src</b> folder, create 
          <b>testClassFactory.py</b> as shown:</p>

class DBTest(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        C = build_row("user", "id name email")
        self.c = C([1, "Steve Holden", "steve@holdenweb.com"])

    def test_attributes(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.c.id, 1)
        self.assertEqual(self.c.name, "Steve Holden")
        self.assertEqual(self.c.email, "steve@holdenweb.com")

    def test_repr(self):
        self.assertEqual(repr(self.c),
                         "user_record(1, 'Steve Holden', 'steve@holdenweb.com')")

     <p>You're really soaking up this information! You now you have enough knowledge 
         to be able to query a database. Good job! But we still haven't 
        talked about updating databases yet. There are three particularly important 
        SQL statements that we'll want to consider: INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. 
       In upcoming lessons, we investigate how those
         statements can be automated on a case-by-case basis. For now, you're ready to leave the world of 
         databases behind and immerse yourself in an entirely different technology: e-mail. See you in the next lesson...</p>
