 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">A Really Useful Program</div><div class="headingText"> 
        
     <p>You have picked up lots of empowering skills in this course. You know how to build GUIs, you understand 
         about various types of persistent storage, and you can handle email. In this last lesson, we'll build
         an email storage and retrieval mechanism, then attach that to a graphical user interface so that 
         the user can enter various search criteria and click on a button to see a list of matching messages. 
         Clicking on a message from the list will display the message body. Not only that, but the messages 
         will be stored in a relational database on an entirely different computer from the one running
         the program. How cool is that?</p>
        
     <p>So, how will we be able to search the email? Potentially by date and by partial match on the names and 
         email addresses of senders. We'll also be able to extend this software to handle 
         additional headers as retrieval keys. </p>
        
     <p>We'll start by writing a program to create the necessary table in the MySQL database. We'll 
         follow that with a library to handle storage and retrieval of information in the database, along 
         with tests that exercise the storage and retrieval functionality. Finally, we'll write a GUI-based 
         program to query the database and display the resulting messages. </p>
    
 </div>
 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">A Basic Email Database</div><div class="headingText">
        
     <p>To store messages, we need a defined structure. A single table is the simplest store, so for now, 
         we'll develop a single-table store. Once the basic message storage function is working (and 
         tested!), we'll add columns to the table to enable new types of retrieval. </p>
        
  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Message Identities</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
      <p>The modern email system is pretty good about allocating each individual message a globally-unique 
          identification, which is carried in the <b>Message-Id</b> header. Here's a sample header from the 
          author's current inbox:</p>
          
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Sample Email Header</div><div class="observe"><pre>Message-ID: &lt;20100529085040.32283.76682@betelnutz&gt;
</pre></div></div>
            
      <p>To keep relationships efficient and representations clear, each message in the database will have 
          <i>two</i> unique columns. There will be <b>msgID</b> (an integer column automatically inserted as 
          necessary by the RDBMS and used as the primary key) and <b>msgMessageID</b> (the globally-unique 
          mail system identifier). <b>msgID</b> will be used to refer to a message wherever possible in the 
          system. Messages themselves do sometimes refer to each other by the <b>Message-ID</b> value though, 
          so that access path is worth putting into even a basic implementation.</p>
            
      <p>This initial implementation records the <b>Message-ID</b> header value as a database column so you 
          can use SQL to query it. Later, certain other information will also be extracted from the messages 
          and recorded directly in the database for the same reason. This will allow full relational 
          operations on that data, letting the database do the retrieval tasks for which it is optimized.</p>
        
     <p>The store needs an <i>Application Programmer Interface</i> or <i>API</i>. This intimidating-sounding 
         thing is actually a set of "how-to instructions for users of the message store." 
         The fundamental operations of storage and retrieval are described in the API. Storing a message  
         requires that the message be passed in to the storage function. Retrieving messages requires some kind of 
         identity to be passed in, and for the function to return a message (or raise some sort of 
         MessageNotFound exception). Since you have decided (well, okay, we've decided) to retrieve 
         with both "msgID" and "MessageID," it makes sense to provide two functions. Here is the API that will help you 
         accomplish your tasks: </p>
        
     <div class="c"><table class="tbl"><tbody><tr><th>Function</th><th>Purpose and interface</th></tr><tr><td>store(msg)</td><td>Adds the message to the store and returns its msgID value. If a message with the same value 
                 for the <b>Message-ID</b> header is already present in the store, the msgID of the existing 
                 message is returned.</td></tr><tr><td>message_by_id(id)</td><td>Returns the message whose primary key value is <b>id</b> or raises an exception if no such 
                 message is present.</td></tr><tr><td>message_by_messageid(message_id)</td><td>Returns the message whose MessageId value is <b>message_id</b> or raises an exception if no 
                 such message is present.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

     <p>This is only an initial attempt to define the interface. Don't think of it as something set in stone. Often, 
         after working with a newly-designed API for a little while, it turns out to be less than ideal. 
         In that case, feel free to change it—programmer convenience is more 
         important than strict adherence to existing APIs. Never be afraid to rework a 
         portion of your design; well-designed systems are the result of experimentation and revision. </p>
        
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">The Message Table</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
      <p>The message store is deliberately uncomplicated. You may be surprised at how sophisticated 
          your queries have become by the end of the lesson. Initially there are just three columns: the <b>id</b> 
          (automatically generated by the database), the <b>Message-ID</b> header value, and the <b>message</b>  
          itself, represented in the most fundamental way: as the sequence of characters that was received 
          over the network. This sequence can be parsed by the <span class="darkblue">email</span> module to produce
          <b>email.Message</b> objects. More columns will be added to the database table as its scope and 
          capabilities grow. </p>
            
      <p>Start MySQL at the terminal window, and create this table as shown:</p>
                 
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>mysql&gt; <ins>CREATE TABLE message(</ins>
    -&gt;     <ins>msgID INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,</ins>
    -&gt;     <ins>msgMessageID VARCHAR(128),</ins>
    -&gt;     <ins>msgText LONGTEXT) ENGINE = MYISAM;</ins>
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.18 sec)
</pre></div></div>
            
      <p>That's it. You now have a table in which to store your messages. The message itself is stored as a 
          character sequence in a LONGTEXT column. This particular type of column is designed to allow 
          storage of arbitrary character strings. Email can be tricky stuff to store; not all 
          messages will necessarily be in the same character set and no global default can be applied. 
          (For example, sometimes the header data explains that certain portions of the message are in specific 
          encodings).</p>
            
      

      <p>Processing the message to create an <b>email.Message</b> object is 
          the most efficient way to extract the <b>Message-Id</b> header. For now, if you want to find out 
          anything else about the message once it's been stored, you'll need to read its text in from the database and 
          parse it again. By ensuring all 
          messages are parsed before entering the database, you guarantee they can be parsed upon retrieval.</p>
            
      <p>At some point you may consider using some more efficient storage representation, such as a 
          pickle. But an email is not necessarily best represented as a single object, so your initial 
          approach will be the more conservative one outlined above. Remember—first, make it work! You 
          can update the storage mechanism later if necessary.</p>
            
      <p>You only need two pieces of data in order to insert a new row (representing a new message) into the message 
          table: the Message ID and the bytestring representation of the message. The third 
          column (primary key) will be populated automatically. So if you have the Message ID and the string 
          representation in variables <span class="darkred">message_id</span>, and <span class="darkred">text</span> respectively, 
          along with a database cursor in <span class="purple">curs</span>, the required statement would 
          look like this:</p>
      
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: Inserting Data in the message Table</div><div class="observe"><pre><span class="purple">curs</span>.execute("INSERT INTO message(msgMessageID, msgText) VALUES (%s, %s)",
            (<span class="darkred">message_id</span>, <span class="darkred">text</span>))

      <p>Now that the table has been created, you need Python functionality that allows you to store, and 
          retrieve, email messages.</p>
      
      <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Users of this API don't need to know how the 
          data is stored in the database. If the API does not provide them with the features they need,

          only your code updates the database, then only you are responsible for its consistency. This is a
          good practice to adhere to in database management.</td></tr></tbody></table> </p>
            
      <p>Before you insert the message into the database, you need to make sure that it isn't in there 
          already. You could either retrieve the set of all rows having the given message ID and make sure that 
          it is empty, or you could count all of the rows with a specific message-id. Since you need the 
          primary key of the message when it <i>is</i> present in the database anyway (to return as the value of

      <p>This <b>maildb</b> module defines a single function, which takes a parsed <b>email.Message</b> and 
          its textual equivalent as arguments. First, the function extracts the message's <b>Message-ID</b> 
          header value, and attempts to retrieve the <b>msgid</b> of the message with that <b>message_id</b> 
          (in case it already exists).</p>

      <p>Sadly, we broke the first rule of test-driven development here! Remember it? "Only write code to make a failing test pass." 
          But we wrote the code before writing 
          the tests. Yes, we have led 
          you down a dark and evil path. Don't let us do it again! Let's write the tests now. To get going in the 
          right direction, we'll even add some tests that we know the existing code cannot pass, and 
          then augment our code to make them pass in true test-driven development fashion.</p>

      <p>In our consideration of email, we saw that the <b>Message-ID</b> header was a possible (candidate) 
          primary key. While we do need to store this value as a column in the database (messaging systems 
          often use <b>Message-ID</b> values to refer to other messages), it should not be the primary 
          key—it's too long, and strings take longer to compare than numbers. So we made the primary 
          key the <b>msgid</b> column, with values that are automatically allocated as rows are added to the 
          database. </p>
            
      <p>Now we can store messages in the database, right? Well, the only way to test storage is 
          to retrieve data and verify that it agrees with what was stored. So we need a way of 
          getting the information out—in fact we need two ways. We need to be able to retrieve a message with a 
          given primary key, and with a given <b>Message-ID</b> header value. The code for each is somewhat 
          similar. </p>
            
      <p>Here's our testing strategy: each message is reconstituted from a text file, then stored using the 
          <span class="darkgreen">maildb.store()</span> function. As the program iterates over the message files and 
          stores the messages, it builds two dicts. The first one, <b>msgids</b>, maps <b>Message-ID</b> 
          values to primary keys. The second, <b>message_ids</b>, maps primary key values to 
          <b>Message-ID</b> values. The content of the dicts is used by the 
          <span class="darkgreen">test_msg_ids()</span> and <span class="darkgreen">test_message_ids()</span> methods to 
          verify that the expected message does indeed come back after retrieval by one or the other of the 
          keys.</p>

          great news—it means we're in proper test-driven development mode, now all we have to do is write those 
          functions to pass the tests. Both of the retrieval functions return the message and its 
          primary key. No matter how data is retrieved, store it

      <p>The <span class="darkgreen">msg_by_id()</span> function takes a primary key (id) value as its argument and 
          executes a query to retrieve the message (along with the primary key). If this query returns an 
          empty result set, the function raises a KeyError exception. Otherwise, 
          <span class="darkgreen">msg_by_id()</span> extracts the message text and its primary key from the database,

      <p>This test mechanism is somewhat inefficient because it creates the table and then drops it 
          for each individual test; it would be better to run the data creation once and then run each

  <a name="s_04"></a><div id="s_04"><div class="subheading">Extending the Database's Retrieval Capabilities</div><div class="subheadingText">
           
      <p>According to our tests, we can now store email messages in a relational database and retrieve them 
          either by primary key or Message-ID value. The Message-ID is extracted from the message when it is
          stored. It doesn't hurt to leave records lying around after a test, to allow testers to 
          query the database manually and see what else can be done with the records, though 
          the production installers prefer to have the tables left in a known empty state. 
          It <i>certainly</i> doesn't hurt to know that the table passed its basic tests after installation. 
          There are other pieces of information about the messages that you might like to store in the relational 
          database to expand your retrieval capabilities even further. Specifically, you want to be able to
          retrieve messages sent between specific dates and/or times, and from specific senders, by name or 
          address. </p>
            
      <p>To accomplish that, we'll add a new column containing the message date. 
          But it wouldn't be particularly useful 
          to store it as a text column in the database, because the database cannot execute time-based 
          calculations on strings. So instead, after you have extracted the <b>Date</b> 
          header value from the parsed message, convert it into a Python <b>datetime.datetime</b> object, 
          which the database driver will then convert into a MySQL DATETIME value, for storage in the database.</p>
            
      <p>We'll modify the test program, adding a <b>msgDate</b> column to the table definition and add tests 
          of the date retrieval function. We'll write that function later; it will look like this:</p>
                
      <p><b>def msgs_by_date(mindate, maxdate)</b></p>
                
      <p>Retrieval by date is different from retrieval by primary key or <b>Message-ID</b>—there is a 
          real possibility that multiple messages will have the same date, causing the new function to return 
          multiple records.</p>
            
      <p>Our tests should work independently of the test data. To test the date 
          routine, we'll change the date creation code in the <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> method so that it also 
         records the minimum and maximum datetime and a message count. Then we'll add a third test, 
          <span class="darkgreen">test_dates()</span>, that requests retrieval of all messages between the minimum 
          and maximum datetimes, and verifies that the count is correct, and that all messages have the correct 
          msgid values. Modify <b>testMaildb.py</b> as shown:</p>

      <p>Now we have a program that will list the subject lines of the messages that meet the search 
          criteria. By default, you'll see whatever content is in the database (which is usually 
          whatever was left by the last test in the messages table). So the window looks more or less the same 
          when you run it as it did before, except that you see messages listed in the Listbox. </p>
            
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Email Search and Display_files/GUIList.png"></div><p></p>
            
      <p>The final step is to connect a double-click on a Listbox entry to display the content of that 
          message in the Text widget at the bottom of the window. Again, the code changes are fairly straightforward. 
          The required double-click event is bound to the new 
          <span class="darkgreen">display_mail()</span> method, and the method extracts the selection from the 
          Listbox and deletes any existing content from the Text widget. Then it inserts up to three headers, 
          followed by a blank line and the body of the 
          messages (unless it happens to be a multipart message—those are a little trickier to handle).

      <p><img src="./Email Search and Display_files/icon_run.png"> When you run this modified code, you see the final 
          (but not necessarily complete) form of our GUI-based mail retrieval program. It searches messages 
          by date range, sender name, and email address, and allows you to view any message in the search 
          results by double-clicking the message subject. This sort of code might be considered "alpha 
          quality"—it can be released for testing purposes, but it's not quite ready for prime time. </p>

      <p>The appearance of the interface could be improved, but the program's basic design is sound. 
          The program is 
          constructed plainly, and we can see how to extend it in various ways. </p>
            
      <p>For example, if you wanted to add subject search features, it's pretty clear  
          that you'd need to add an <b>msgSubject</b> column to the message table and therefore to the 
          logic of <span class="darkgreen">maildb.store()</span>. The interface to 
          <span class="darkgreen">maildb.msgs()</span> would need to be augmented by a <b>subjectsearch</b> argument, and
          the GUI would need to add another Entry element to capture the user's search string. Fortunately, this program 
          is logically organized, and you should be able to proceed with confidence. </p>
