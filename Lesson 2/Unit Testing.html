 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">unittest</div><div class="headingText">
        
     <p>Your first lesson in Python 2 picks up where we left off in the Python 1 course, focused on debugging 
         programs. Here you'll learn about the second, and more widely used, built-in Python testing 
         framework, <i>unittest</i>. Unittest is a more formal testing framework, which can be integrated with 
         existing uses of <i>doctest</i>, if necessary.</p>

  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Assertions</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>An important statement contained within Python that you haven't come across before is the <i>assert</i> statement. 
          The syntax for this statement is:</p>

<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE: assert statement syntax</div><div class="observe"><pre>assert <span class="darkred">condition</span>[, <span class="darkblue">message</span>]
</pre></div></div>

      <p>In the assert statement, the <span class="darkred">condition</span> is tested, and if it evaluates false, an AssertionError exception 
          is raised. If there's a <span class="darkblue">message</span>, it is printed with the AssertionError. Let's 
          try using the assert statement right now in an interactive console window. </p>

      <p>In case you've forgotten how to get to the interactive console, here's how to do it:</p>

      <p>Select the <b>Console</b> tab in the workspace window, and click the down arrow to the right of 
          the <b>Open Console</b> icon:</p> 
      
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/OpenConsoleSelectionIcon.gif"></div><p></p>

      <p>Select <b>Pydev Console</b> from the pull-down menu:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/ConsoleMenuPyDev.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>

      <p>Select <b>Python console</b>:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/PyDevConsoleSelect.png"></div><p></p>

      <p>A new console appears, with the interactive prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>. The console is ready for your 
          input:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/PyDevConsole1.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>
      <p>Type this code into the interactive interpreter console:</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>assert 1 == 1</ins>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>assert 1 == 2</ins>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AssertionError
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>assert 1 == 2, "One isn't two and the universe is still rational"</ins>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AssertionError: One isn't two and the universe is still rational
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div></div>

      <p>We use assert statements in our programs to assert conditions that we believe 
          must always be true. If we are correct, the program runs as expected, but if 
          a programming error or mistaken assumption invalidates the condition, Python will let us know, 
          usually early in the life of the program. </p>

      <p>AssertionError exceptions are handled using the 
          unittest module. To write tests, we create <i>test cases</i> that are subclasses of the 
          <span class="darkred">unittest.TestCase</span> class. Our subclasses can use the methods defined by the superclass. 
          Many of those methods' names begin with the prefix "assert." By calling these methods, you have the test 
          case make assertions about your program in a controlled environment. Any 
          AssertionErrors that arise are handled by the framework and reported as a failure of the associated test. 
          Other exceptions are regarded as errors. </p>

  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">A Basic unittest Example</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>For our first example, we'll use the <span class="darkgreen">square()</span> method from our <b>testable.py</b> code
          that we created in the "Introduction to Python" course.
          Our goal now is to write code that will cube the values passed. This will allow 
          us to compare the two testing modules.</p>

      <p>Just to make sure we're all up to speed, let's review setting 
          up a new PyDev project and a Python program:</p>

      <p>To start a new project, select the menu item <b>File | New | PyDev Project</b>. Enter the name 
          <b>UnitTesting</b>, select <b>3.0</b> for the Grammar Version, and select the 
          <b>python</b> interpreter (if it's not available, click on the link to configure an interpreter):</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/NewProjectUnitTesting.png"></div><p></p>

      <p>If you clicked the link to configure the interpreter, go to the Preferences screen now and click 
          <b>Auto Config</b>:</p> 

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/PreferencesAutoConfig.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>

      <p>A <b>Selection Needed</b> screen appears. Click <b>OK</b> to select the default settings:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/SelectionNeeded.gif"></div><p></p>

      <p>Click <b>OK</b> to return to the Pydev Project screen, then click <b>Finish</b>. You'll see a 
          prompt to change perspectives. Check the <b>Remember my decision</b> box and then click <b>No</b>:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/OpenAssociatedPerspective.gif" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>

      <p>When you first create a PyDev project, it is placed in the Other Projects working set. 
          It's a good idea to keep your Python projects together, so go ahead and put your newly created 
          project into the Python2_Lessons working set. In the <b>Other Projects</b> working set, find the 
          <b>UnitTesting</b> 
          project. Right-click it and select <b>Assign Working Sets...</b>:</p> 

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/AssignWorkingSetsUnitTesting.png"></div><p></p>

      <p>The <b>Working Set Assignments</b> screen appears. Click <b>Deselect All</b> to clear any selected 
          working sets, and then check the box for the <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set (the one for 
          this course). Uncheck the <b>Show only Package Explorer working sets</b> box, and click 
          <b>OK</b>:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/WorkingSetAssignmentsUnitTesting.png"></div><p></p>

      <p>You will need to do this for each new project you create. (Your working sets may differ from those shown here; 
          you'll only see working sets for the courses in which you are enrolled.) </p>

      <p>To see only the working sets for this course, click the drop-down arrow next to <b>Show Working Sets</b>, 
          and select <b>Python | Python 2</b>:</p>
      
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/ShowWorkingSetsPython2.png" style="cursor: zoom-in;"></div><p></p>

      <p>Your <b>UnitTesting</b> project is now listed in the <b>Package Explorer</b> panel on the lower left corner of 
          your Eclipse screen, in your <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set.</p>

      <p>This hierarchical view of available resources (directories and files) in Eclipse is commonly called the 
          <i>workspace</i>. You now have a <i>project</i> named <b>UnitTesting</b> in your workspace.</p>

      <p>Before you go on, make sure that the <b>UnitTesting</b> project is displayed in the 
          Package Explorer window. Click on this new project to select it.</p>

      <p>From the <b>File</b> menu, select <b>New | File</b>. A New File dialog box appears. Select the 
          <b>src</b> subdirectory of <b>UnitTesting</b>, enter the filename <b>testable.py</b>, and 
          then click <b>Finish</b>:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Unit Testing_files/NewFileTestable.png"></div><p></p>

      <p>A new editor window appears next to the workspace. We'll use this editor because it understands 
          Python syntax. In <b>testable.py</b>, type the <ins>blue code</ins> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>"""Demonstrates the unittest module in action."""

def cube(x):

    return x*3

class TestCube(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_small_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(cube(3), 27, "Cube of 3 is not 27")
    
    def test_large_number(self):
        self.assertEqual(cube(1000), 1000000000, "Cube of 1000 should be 1000000000")        
        
    def test_bad_input(self):
        self.assertRaises(TypeError, cube, 'x')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()</ins>
</pre></div></div>
      
      <p>To run the program, right-click in the editor window and select <b>Run As...</b>, and  
          select <b>Python Run</b>.  
          This program contains a bug: instead of returning its argument raised to the third power (cubed), 
          the <span class="darkgreen">cube()</span> function returns its argument multiplied by three. This is an easy 
          mistake to make—we just omitted a single asterisk (*)—but it renders the function incorrect. 
          When you run the program, you see output that looks something like this:</p>

FAILED (failures=3)
</pre></div></div>

      <p>Failures. Bummer. And not only do we have failures, our program gives us even more data than doctest did. 
          For example, our program 
         gives the number of tests, followed by the length of time it took to run the tests, and the tests themselves can be 
          set up to pass messages to the person running the tests.</p> 

      <p>When you run the program, it calls the <span class="darkgreen">unittest.main()</span> method, which 
          runs the <i>unittest Test Runner</i>. The Test Runner looks in your code for test suites, which 
          are identified as Classes that inherit from the <span class="darkred">unittest.TestCase</span> class. These 
          test suites contain a number of tests, which are class methods that begin with the word "test."</p>

      <p>Because the assertions within your unittest methods raise AssertionErrors, the package reports 
          them as test failures, and the output makes it clear that something is wrong with the program. 
          In fact, because of the message arguments passed to the methods, you get a pretty good idea of 
          what is going wrong. Now, fix the error by changing the operation in the 
          <span class="darkgreen">cube()</span> function to an exponentiation. Modify <b>testable.py</b> as shown:</p>

<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>"""Demonstrates the unittest module in action."""

          <p>Right-click in the editor window and select <b>Run As | Python unit-test</b>. With the error now corrected, 
          your output from <b>testable.py</b> looks like this:</p>

          test count and the time for the duration of the tests' run. Chances are that for this basic test, 
          you'll get a value of 0.000, but keep in mind that unittests are not performance tests. You'll

      <p>The <span class="darkgreen">test_small_number()</span> method in the <span class="darkred">TestCube</span> class 
          has a single statement: a call to the <span class="darkblue">assertEqual()</span> method 
          inherited from <span class="purple">unittest</span><span class="darkred">.testCase</span>. That statement contains an 
          assertion that its first two arguments are equal—that <span class="blue">cube(3)</span> is equal to 
          <span class="red">27</span>. If the values do not match, then the assertion fails and the message 
          <span class="orange">"Cube of 3 should be 27"</span> is returned during the test and reported by the 
          framework.</p>
            
      <p>If you include useful assertion error messages, they will help you remember what your tests are 
          supposed to be doing. They will also help other programmers understand your tests. It's easier 
          to figure out what to fix when error messages are meaningful (fortunately, 
          the default messages produced by unittest have improved recently, as well).</p>
          
      <p>In the third test, <span class="darkgreen">test_bad_input()</span> checks to see if the 
          <span class="green">cube()</span> function throws a <span class="darkred">TypeError</span> exception. The first 
          argument provided is the expected exception; the second argument is the function to test; the 
          remaining arguments will be passed to the function in question— the <span class="green">cube()</span> function (a one-argument 
          function, so you see a single additional argument <span class="purple">'x'</span>); it is possible to use
          both positional and keyword arguments (but the function you are testing doesn't take any keyword arguments). Using 
          this method lets you verify that certain inputs raise specific exceptions.</p>

  <a name="s_04"></a><div id="s_04"><div class="subheading">Test-Driven Development: Tests As Specifications</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>Now that you've begun to appreciate the value of testing, follow the basic rule of test-driven 
          development (TDD): only write code to make a failing test pass. This means that you 
          begin your development projects by creating tests, which then act as a 
          specification for the behavior of the program. By developing software this way, 
          the programmer is forced to develop only the necessary functionality, and resists including extraneous elements. 
          As the agile programming community says, 
          "YAGNI"—You Ain't Gonna Need It. If it doesn't help you pass a test, it really isn't 
          necessary. </p>

  </div></div>
  <a name="s_05"></a><div id="s_05"><div class="subheading">Background of unittest</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>Kent Beck, the creator of <i>Extreme Programming</i> and <i>Test Driven 
          Development</i>, wrote a testing framework for agile programming in the 
          Smalltalk programming language. Later, along with Erich Gamma, he wrote a Java-based 
          implementation of this test framework called JUnit. This test framework has since been ported 
          to many other languages, including Python, where it is sometimes called "PyUnit."</p>

      <p>The advantage of unittest is that the core concepts are tried and tested. This is important in 
          a test framework because that means you can rely on it. As we learned in the previous course, 
          if we refactor our code and it still passes the tests, we can be reasonably sure that we haven't 
          introduced an error.</p>

      <p>unittest uses these important concepts:</p>

      <ul><li><b>Test Fixtures:</b> The setup for your tests. Fixtures include creation of temporary 
              databases, servers, and anything else needed to run the test. The fixtures frequently need 
              to be cleaned up after a test. To use a spelling test analogy, think of a Test Fixture as a 
              combination pencil, eraser, test sheet, and word list.</li><li><b>Test Cases:</b> Each test case is an individual test. It checks for a specific response 
              to an assertion, and then is distilled to a boolean statement. Using the spelling test analogy 
              again, think of a Test Case as a single question on the test.</li><li><b>Test Suite:</b> A test suite is a collection of Test Cases (or even other <b>Test 
              Suites</b>). Returning to our spelling test again, think of a Test Suite as the set of all 
              questions on the test sheet.</li><li><b>Test Runner:</b> The software that actually runs the tests. The runner can be launched 
               from the command line, graphical interface, web interface, or any other input method. It 
               returns special values to indicate the success of the tests, and these values can be 
               evaluated by you or by various automated tools. In the spelling test analogy, the test 
               runner would be you, the reader, going through the list of questions.</li></ul>

      <p>So, which should you use, doctest or unittest? To a certain extent, this is a matter of individual preference. 
          Let's compare the two:</p> 

      <table class="tbl"><tbody><tr><th>doctest</th><th>unittest</th></tr><tr><td>More readily accessible</td><td>More challenging to learn</td></tr><tr><td>Documents your code to some degree</td><td>Maintains a clean separation between tests and documentation</td></tr><tr><td>Harder to maintain as features change</td><td>Easier to maintain as features change</td></tr><tr><td>Assertions are more difficult to incorporate</td><td>Assertions are the primary tools for verifying correct performance</td></tr><tr><td>Verbose</td><td>Concise</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <p>The Python community generally agrees that while doctests have their place, unittests are 
          usually more useful. doctests are easier to learn, but in the 
          long run, unittests are the more streamlined choice. 
          It is possible to integrate doctests in a unittest environment, though not quite as 
          straightforward as you might like.</p>

      <p>Congratulations! Just like that, you are now equipped with a second Python test framework. 
          In the lessons to come, we'll use 
          both test frameworks to check our work and build good programming habits. 
          According to the tenets of agile programming, test-driven 
          development is the way to go. TDD lets you 
          continue to refactor your code without introducing errors, and it encourages other programmers to love you for your 
          devotion to best practices. In the 
          next lesson, we'll explore test-driven development even further. See you there!</p>
