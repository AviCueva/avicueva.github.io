     <p>So far, we've learned that tests enable us to refactor code, and that refactoring lets us 
         improve our code's clarity and performance. To support testing, we've learned two test 
         frameworks in Python, <i>doctest</i> and <i>unittest</i>. With those tools in hand, we're ready to
         dive into 
          <i>Test-Driven Development</i> (we'll call it TDD from now on) .</p>

     <p>The concept of TDD is pretty straightforward. Once you've identified the requirements of a program, you begin creating it, 
         not by 
         coding, but by writing tests. After you're satisfied with the tests you've written (which may 
         require lots of trial and error, but hey, you're human), you write the code that will pass the 
         tests. The general outline for TDD workflow incorporates the mantra of agile programmers everywhere: "Do the 
         simplest thing that could possibly work." </p>

     <ol><li>Write tests</li><li>Run tests</li><li>Write some code to pass the tests</li><li>Run tests</li><li>Refactor code</li><li>Repeat</li></ol>

     <p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

     <p>You know, if you think about it, you've already done some TDD—well almost. In the projects for Python 1,  
         as well as your first project for Python 2, you were given a set of requirements and then some expected 
         results. In those cases, formal tests of your code which were performed  
         by running the program, stimulating it with specific inputs, and observing and validating the 
         results.</p>
        
     <p>If you automate testing, you can repeat the tests reliably 
         whenever you want. And thanks to doctest and unittest, you can include formal tests of your code in 
         the lessons and projects to come.</p>

      <p>Below is an example of the first step of TDD, <span class="purple">writing tests</span>. Suppose that you have been asked 
          to develop an <span class="darkgreen">adder(x, y)</span> function that takes two arguments and adds 
          them together using a somewhat unusual definition of "add": integer + integer, string + string 
          and list + list, use regular addition; integer + string converts the integer to a string before 
          concatenation; and adding a string or an integer to a list, appends to the list (regardless of whether 
          it's the first or second argument). </p>

      <p>All five tests have failed. But we expected them to fail (yes, we did), because our 
          <span class="darkgreen">adder()</span> method doesn't actually do anything yet. While failed tests are not the 
          ideal result, at least the tests didn't result in error messages. When you see error messages, they 
          usually indicate the presence of a programming mistake, for instance, a function may have the wrong 
          number of arguments, or a call to a method that an object doesn't have. But since our code didn't return any 
          error messages, we can move on to step three of the TDD cycle: <span class="purple">write code to pass the 
              tests</span>. In this first instance, we won't try and pass <i>all</i> of

      <p>The first line now contains three dots, each representing a successful test (give 
          yourself a pat on the back for those!), and two "E" characters. Those E's represent errors that we get 
          because our implementation works for only 60% of the test cases. That's not bad for a
          one-line function though, and the output from the test-run provides lots of information 
          that helps us figure out how to stop the function 
          from throwing exceptions and causing those errors.</p>
      
      <p>The problems in our code seem to pop up when the arguments aren't of the same type. Since the function 
          appears to do what we need it to do most of the time, we'll modify our 
          program explicitly to change its performance just in the failing cases. We'll do that by adding an integer and 
          a string, and adding an integer and a list (this last case should apply when adding 
          anything to a list, not just an integer). </p>

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">More About the unittest.TestCase Class</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
      <p>The <span class="darkred">TestCase</span> class is the cornerstone of the unittest module.  
          We've learned to create our own test cases as subclasses of <span class="darkred">TestCase</span>. Individual 
          tests are written as methods of the subclass and have names that begin with the string "test." If 
          you have only one test to run, you may implement that test as the class's 
          <span class="darkgreen">runTest()</span> method. You probably won't do that very much, 
          but you may see it in other people's code, so it's worth knowing.</p>
        
  </div></div>
     
     <a name="s_03"></a><div id="s_03"><div class="subheading">Test Fixture Set-up and Tear-down</div><div class="subheadingText">
         
      <p>If you want to define several tests, you could create a separate <span class="darkred">TestCase</span> 
          subclass for each one, but it's much simpler to create a single subclass with several test 
          methods instead. So, why might you need more than one <span class="darkred">TestCase</span> subclass? 
          Well, one possibility is so that you can include <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> and 
          <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span> methods, which would be run before and after each test 
          method. In this case (as well as in others), grouping tests that require the same 
          set-up and tear-down processing, is a good way to go. </p>
            
      <p>Suppose you want to run some tests of code you have written that creates files. Each test 
          needs to create files. And since the tests create random files (or at least since each test 
          creates different files), if you run the tests in any old 
          directory, clean-up could be difficult. To avoid creating such problems for ourselves, 
          we'll write our code so that each test method creates the directory itself and cleans up the files it 
          creates. To make our code even more efficient, we'll have it call a function to create the directory 
          which was called 
          by each test method. We could take it even further and create the directory within the 
          <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> method. This is called automatically before the framework 
          calls each test method, just as the <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span>method is called after 
          each one. So we could use <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span> to empty and delete the 
          directory. </p>
            
      <p>If the <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> method raises an exception, the test framework will 
          declare this test to have errors, and the test method will not be run. If it succeeds, the 
          test is run, followed by the <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span> method.</p>

      <p>Here, you have defined a test case with two test methods. In order to make the test runnable 
          anywhere, first the <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> method saves the process's current 
          directory (obtained with <span class="darkgreen">os.getcwd()</span> in an instance variable). Then it 
          uses <span class="darkgreen">tempfile.mkdtemp()</span> to create a new temporary directory—the 
          location it chooses will depend on your platform, so the method prints the directory path out 
          for your inspection. Having created the new directory, <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> then 
          makes it the current directory. </p>
            
      <p>The <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span> method is called after each test. It makes the saved 
          directory the current directory again (thereby ensuring that the temporary directory is no 
          longer in use), and removes it (along with any content it may have) using 
          <span class="darkgreen">shutil.rmtree()</span>. </p>
            
      <p>When you run the program, you might see something like this: </p>

      <p>Here, the output from the test code itself is mixed with the <span class="red">..</span> output from the testing 
          framework, making it difficult to see exactly what's happening (though the absence of error 
          messages is reassuring). It isn't usually a good idea to produce output from test cases for a couple of reasons. 
          First, when the test succeeds there should be no output—this makes it much easier to 
          determine whether tests have passed or failed. Second, it's quite possible that nobody will 
          read that output anyway. </p>
            
      
          <p>You may find that you prefer to run your tests using the features built-in to Ellipse 
          to handle unit tests. To do so, select the <b>setupDemo.py</b> file and then choose 
          <b>Run | Run As | Python unit-test</b>. Then, your output will look like this: </p>

      <p>The docstring for each test is now printed before the test starts, but the 
          <b>print</b> statements are definitely interfering with the output.  
          One way to correct this would be to remove the top-level instructions that call the 
          <span class="darkgreen">unittest.main()</span> function. 
          When you ask Ellipse to run the program as a unit test, 
          it automatically performs the work in the top-level instructions anyway. But in most cases, you'll want to retain that code;
          without it the program will not run correctly as a stand-alone 
          module (run from outside Ellipse).</p>
      <p>So instead, we'll remove the 
          <b>print</b> statements when we modify our 
          code. Let's do that now. Edit <b>setupDemo.py</b> as shown:</p>

      <p>When you run <span class="darkgreen">unittest.main()</span>, or when Eclipse runs a program as a Python 
          unit test, all subclasses of <span class="darkred">unittest.TestCase</span> are taken from the 
          <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a>. 
          An instance of each subclass is created, and each method of the class with a name that begins with 
          "test" is called. (These calls are preceded by a call to the <span class="darkgreen">setUp()</span> 
          method if it exists, and followed by a call to the <span class="darkgreen">tearDown()</span> method 
          if it exists).</p>
            
      <p>All of the above actions are taken when we call the TestCase's <span class="darkgreen">run()</span> method. 
          The <span class="darkred">TestCase</span> class records the results of the call in a special object, and they are
          summarized in the output of the test framework, after all tests have been run. </p>
        
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_05"></a><div id="s_05"><div class="subheading">TestCase Methods</div><div class="subheadingText">
            
      <p>There are a number of methods you can call to make assertions about your program's state. The most commonly used 
          TestCase Methods are:</p>
            
      <table class="tbl"><tbody><tr><th>TestCase Method</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>assertTrue(expr[, msg])</td><td>Unless <b>expr</b> evaluates as true, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertFalse(expr[, msg])</td><td>If <b>expr</b> evaluates as true, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertEqual(first, second[, msg])</td><td>Unless <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> are equal, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertNotEqual(first, second[, msg])</td><td>If <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> are equal, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertAlmostEqual(first, second[, places[, msg]])</td><td>Computes the difference between <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> and rounds it to 
                  <b>places</b> decimal places. If the rounded result is non-zero, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertNotAlmostEqual(first, second[, places[, msg]])</td><td>Computes the difference between <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> and rounds it to 
                  <b>places</b> decimal places. If the rounded result is zero, the test fails.</td></tr><tr><td>assertRaises(exception, callable, ...)</td><td>Calls <b>callable</b>, passing it any positional and keyword arguments that follow. 
                  If the call does not raise the given exception, the test fails.</td></tr></tbody></table>
            
      <p>The methods above do have alternative names (<span class="darkgreen">assertTrue()</span>, for example, is 
          also known as <span class="darkgreen">assert_()</span>), but the names above are preferred.  
          Most of these methods take an optional message argument. If you don't provide a message,  
          unittest will try to formulate one that gives you as much information as possible. To test 
          this, create a new program named <b>messagetest.py</b> in your <b>TestDrivenDevelopment/src</b>

          that the first list has an extra element. This informative message is the result of some recent clean-up work

      <p>In this lesson, you've learned about some basic functions of the unittest module. This 
          will serve you well during the course, but we've only scratched the surface of unittest!</p>
         <p> You have also learned to engage test-driven development 
          practices.  
          For the rest of this course, and all following courses in the OST Python series, you'll be required to use this 
          methodology, in fact, your instructor 
          will verify that you've solved problems successfully by running tests against it. By the 
          end of this course, you'll be really comfortable with TDD and unittest, and
          writing tests will become second nature to you!</p>
        
  </div></div>

    <p>In the next lesson, we'll learn about some of Python's file-handling abilities.
