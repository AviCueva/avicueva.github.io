    <p>Welcome to the O'Reilly School of Technology's (OST) <b>Getting More Out of Python</b>
        course! We're happy you've chosen to learn Python programming with us. By the time you
        finish the course, you will have expanded your knowledge of Python and applied it to 
        some really interesting technologies.</p>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Learning with O'Reilly School of Technology Courses</div><div class="headingText">  
  <p>As with every O'Reilly School of Technology course, we'll take a <i>user-active</i> 
    approach to learning. This means that you (the user) will be active! You'll learn by doing,  
    building live programs, testing them and experimenting with themâ€”hands-on!</p>
  
  <p>To learn a new skill or technology, you have to experiment. The more you experiment, the more 
    you learn. Our system is designed to maximize experimentation and help you <i>learn to 
      learn</i> a new skill.</p>
  
  <p>We'll program as much as possible to be sure that the principles sink in and stay with you.</p>
  
  <p>Each time we discuss a new concept, you'll put it into code and see what YOU can do with it.  
   On occasion we'll even give you code that doesn't work, so you can see common mistakes and how 
   to recover from them. Making mistakes is actually another good way to learn.</p>  
    
  <p>Above all, we want to help you to <i>learn to learn</i>. We give you the tools to take control 
    of your own learning experience. </p>

  <p>When you complete an OST course, you know the subject matter, <i>and</i> you know how to 
    expand your knowledge, so you can handle changes like software and operating system updates.</p>
   
   <p>Here are some tips for using O'Reilly School of Technology courses effectively:</p>

  <ul><li><b>Type the code.</b> Resist the temptation to cut and paste the example code we give you. 
    Typing the code  
      actually gives you a feel for the programming task. Then play around with the examples to find out what 
      else you can make them do, and to check your understanding. It's highly
      unlikely you'll break anything by experimentation. If you <i>do</i> break something, that's an indication to us that 
      we need to improve our system!</li><li><b>Take your time.</b> Learning takes time. Rushing can have negative effects on your 
      progress. Slow down and let your brain absorb the new information thoroughly. 
      Taking your time helps to maintain a relaxed, positive approach. It also gives you the 
      chance to try new things and learn more than you otherwise would if you blew 
      through all of the coursework too quickly.</li><li><b>Experiment.</b> Wander from the path often and explore the possibilities. We can't 
      anticipate all of your questions and ideas, so it's up to you to experiment and create on 
      your own. Your instructor will help if you go completely off the rails.</li><li><b>Accept guidance, but don't depend on it.</b> Try to solve problems on your own. Going 
      from misunderstanding to understanding is the best way to acquire a new skill. Part of what 
      you're learning is problem solving. Of course, you can always contact your instructor 
      for hints when you need them.</li><li><b>Use all available resources!</b> In real-life problem-solving, you aren't bound by false 
      limitations; in OST courses, you are free to use any resources at your disposal to solve
      problems you encounter: the Internet, reference books, and online help are all fair game.   
      </li><li><b>Have fun!</b> Relax, keep practicing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes! 
      Your instructor will keep you at it until you've 
      mastered the skill. We want you to get that satisfied, "I'm so cool! I did it!"
      feeling. And you'll have some projects to show off when you're done.</li></ul>

 <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">Lesson Format</div><div class="headingText">
        
    <p>We'll try out lots of examples in each lesson. We'll have you write code, 
    look at code, and edit existing code. The code will be presented in boxes that will 
    indicate what needs to be done to the code inside.</p>
        
    <p>Whenever you see white boxes like the one below, you'll <i>type</i> the contents into the editor window to try the example yourself. 
      The CODE TO TYPE bar on top of the white box contains directions for you to follow:</p>
        
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE:</div><div class="listing"><pre>White boxes like this contain code for you to try out (type into a file to run).

If you have already written some of the code, new code for you to add <ins>looks like this</ins>. 
    
If we want you to remove existing code, the code to remove <del>will look like this</del>.
  
<span class="gray">We may also include instructive comments that you don't need to type.</span>  
</pre></div></div>
   
   <p>We may run programs and do some other activities in a terminal session in the operating system or other command-line environment. These will be shown 
     like this:</p>
   
<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">INTERACTIVE SESSION:</div><div class="interactive"><pre>The plain black text that we present in these INTERACTIVE boxes is 
provided by the system (not for you to type). The commands we want you to type <ins>look like this</ins>.
</pre></div></div>   
        
  <p>Code and information presented in a gray OBSERVE box is for you to <i>inspect</i> and <i>absorb</i>. 
  This information is often color-coded, and followed by text explaining the code in detail:</p>
        
<div class="observeBox"><div class="observeTitle">OBSERVE:</div><div class="observe"><pre>Gray "Observe" boxes like this contain <span class="darkred">information</span> (usually code specifics) for you to <i>observe</i>.
</pre></div></div>

   <p>The paragraph(s) that follow may provide addition details on <span class="darkred">information</span> that was 
     highlighted in the Observe box.</p>
   
   <p>We'll also set especially pertinent information apart in "Note" boxes:</p>      
   
   <p></p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">Notes provide information that is useful, but not absolutely necessary for performing the tasks at hand.</td></tr></tbody></table></div> <p></p>
   
   <p></p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Tip</td><td class="note">Tips provide information that might help make the tools easier for you to use, such as shortcut keys.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p>
   
   <p></p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">WARNING</td><td class="note">Warnings provide information that can help prevent program crashes and data loss.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p>
        
 </div> 

      <p>Before you start programming in Python, let's review a couple of the tools you'll be using. If you took <b>Introduction to Python</b>, you can skip to 
         the <a href="http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Python2/IntroductionToEclipse.html#unittest">next section</a> if you like, or you might want to go through this 
         section to refresh your memory.</p>

  <a name="h_01"></a><div class="heading">About Eclipse</div><div class="headingText">

      <p>We're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called Eclipse. It's the program filling 
          up your screen right now. IDEs assist programmers by performing tasks that need to be done 
          repetitively. IDEs can also help to edit and debug code, and organize projects.</p>

  <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">Perspectives and the Red Leaf Icon</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>The Ellipse Plug-in for Eclipse, developed by the O'Reilly School of Technology, adds a Red Leaf 
          icon <img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/icon_redleaf.png"> to the toolbar in Eclipse. This icon is your 
          "panic button." Because Eclipse is versatile and allows you to move things around, like views, toolbars, 
          and such, it's possible to lose your way. If you do get confused and want to return to the default 
          perspective (window layout), the Red Leaf icon is the fastest and easiest way to do that. </p>

      <p>The Red Leaf icon has these functions: </p>

      <ul><li><b>To reset the current perspective:</b> click the icon.</li><li><b>To change perspectives:</b> click the drop-down arrow beside the icon to select different 
              perspectives designed for each course that uses Ellipse. </li><li><b>To select a perspective:</b> click the drop-down arrow beside the Red Leaf icon and select 
              the course (<b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>C++</b>, etc.). Selecting a specific course opens 
              the perspective designed for that particular course.<br><br> 
              
              For this course, you would select <b>Python</b> (it should already be selected for you now):<br><br>

  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">Working Sets</div><div class="subheadingText">

      <p>You'll use <i>working sets</i> for the course. All projects created in Eclipse exist in the 
          workspace directory of your account on our server. As you create multiple projects for each 
          lesson in each course, your directory could become pretty cluttered. A working set is a view of 
          the workspace that behaves like a folder, but it's actually an association of files. Working sets 
          allow you to limit the detail that you see at any given time. The difference between a working set 
          and a folder is that a working set doesn't actually exist in the file system. </p>

      <p>A working set is a convenient way to group related items together. You can assign a project to one 
          or more working sets. In some cases, like the Python extension to Eclipse, new projects are 
          created in a catch-all "Other Projects" working set. To better organize your work, we'll have you 
          assign your projects to an appropriate working set when you create them. To do that, right-click on 
          the project name and select the <b>Assign Working Sets</b> menu item.</p>
      
      <p>We've already created some working sets for you in the Eclipse IDE. You can turn the working set 
          display <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> in Eclipse. </p>
      
      <p>For now, make sure your working sets are displayed  by clicking the down-pointing arrow on the top right 
          of the Package Explorer window, and select <b>Top Level Elements | Working Sets</b>:</p>
      
      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/TopLevelElementsWorkingSets.png"></div><p></p> 
      
      <p>Then, click the down-pointing arrow next to <b>Show Working Sets</b> and select <b>Python | Python 2</b>:</p>

      <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/ShowWorkingSetsPython2.png"></div><p></p>

 <a name="h_02"></a><div class="heading">Programming in Python with Eclipse</div><div class="headingText">
   
   <a name="s_01"></a><div id="s_01"><div class="subheading">A First Program</div><div class="subheadingText">
    
   <p>When learning a new language in computer programming, it is traditional to 
     use the words "hello world" as your first example. Unfortunately, since "hello 
     world" can be written in a single line, that doesn't make for
     a great example in Python. Instead, we'll look at a slightly more complicated 
     example that not only prints "hello" and "goodbye,"
     but also does a little calculation on the way.</p>
    
    <p>Let's set up an environment for our first file. In Eclipse, all files must be within 
      <i>projects</i>. A project is a container that holds resources (such as source code, images, 
      and other things) needed to build a piece of software. We're going to make a project named 
      <b>IntroEclipse</b>. Please use that exact name, with the same 
      capitalization.</p>
      
    <p>In creating a new project, you'll need to read ahead a few steps because once the dialog box appears, 
        you will not be able to return to the Lesson until finishing it. You can also view the 
        <a href="http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Python2/Eclipse%20%28updated%29.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version of the course</a> (right-click the link and open it in another window) 
      while creating the project. This is 
        the only time you should need to work in a separate window in this course.</p>
       
       <p>Now, let's create a <b>PyDev project</b> in Eclipse. (PyDev is the name of the Eclipse
      add-in that adapts it to handle Python). To start a new project, select the menu item 
      <b>File | New | PyDev Project</b>. Enter the name <b>IntroEclipse</b>, select <b>3.0</b> for 
      the Grammar Version, and click the link to configure an interpreter:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/NewProject.png"></div><p></p>
    
    <p>On the Preferences screen, click <b>Auto Config</b> to configure the 
      Python interpreter:</p>
     
     <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/PreferencesAutoConfig.png"></div><p></p>
     
     <p>A Selection Needed screen appears. Click <b>OK</b> to select the default settings:</p>
      
     <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/SelectionNeeded.png"></div><p></p>
     
     <p>Click <b>OK</b> again to return to the Pydev Project screen. Select the <b>python</b> interpreter we just created, and
         make sure <b>Create 'src' folder and add it to the PYTHONPATH' is selected</b>:</p>
       
     <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/SelectInterpreter.png"></div><p></p>
     
     <p>Click <b>Finish</b>. You see a prompt to change perspectives. Check the <b>Remember my decision</b> box and click 
         <b>No</b>:</p>

     <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/OpenAssociatedPerspective.gif"></div><p></p>
      
     <p>When you first create a PyDev project, it is placed in the <b>Other Projects</b> working set. You'll want to keep your 
         Python projects together, so go ahead and put your newly created project into the <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set. 
         Select the <b>IntroEclipse</b> project. Right-click it and select <b>Assign Working Sets...</b>:</p>
     
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/AssignWorkingSet.png"></div><p></p>
     
    <p>The Working Set Assignments screen appears. Click <b>Deselect All</b> to clear
      any selected working sets, and then check the box for the <b>Python2_Lessons</b> 
      working set (the one for this course), UNcheck the <b>Show only Package Explorer working sets</b> box,
      and click <b>OK</b>:</p>
     
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/WorkingSetAssignments.png"></div><p></p>

    <p>Click <b>OK</b> when you finish. You will need to do this for each new project you create.</p>
     
    <p><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note">You might not see as many working sets; you'll only see ones for courses you're enrolled in.</td></tr></tbody></table></p>
     
    <p>To see the projects in your <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set in the Package Explorer panel, click the 
        downward-pointing arrow next to the <b>Show Working Sets</b> button, and select <b>Python | Python2</b>:</p>
       
       <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/ShowWorkingSets.png"></div><p></p>

    <p>Now you should see your <b>IntroEclipse</b> project listed in the 
      <b>Python2_Lessons</b> working set in the <b>Package Explorer</b> panel on the lower left 
      corner of your Eclipse screen:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/PyDevPackageExplorerWithIntroEclipse.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>This hierarchical view of the resources (directories and files) in Eclipse is commonly
      called the <i>workspace</i>. You now have a <i>project</i> called IntroEclipse in your
      workspace.</p>
      
    <p>Before you go on, make sure that the IntroEclipse project is displayed in the Package Explorer window.</p>
      
    <p>Right-click your <b>IntroEclipse</b> project in the Package Explorer, and select <b>New | File</b>. A New File 
        dialog box appears. Select 
      the <b>src</b> subdirectory of <b>IntroEclipse</b>, enter the filename <b>hello_world.py</b>, 
      and then click <b>Finish</b>:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/NewFileHelloWorld.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>A new editor window appears next to the workspace. You'll edit your code in this 
      window because it understands Python syntax. </p>
      
    <p>Enter the <ins>blue</ins> code below into the editor window:</p>
    
    <p></p><div class="c"><table class="noteBox fBox pBox "><tbody><tr><td class="noteTitle">Note</td><td class="note"> When you enter an opening parenthesis, Eclipse automatically adds the closing 
      parenthesis.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p>
      
<div class="listingBox"><div class="listingTitle">CODE TO TYPE: </div><div class="listing"><pre><ins>print("Hello World")
print("I have", 3 + 4, "bananas")
print("Goodbye, World")</ins>
</pre></div></div>
      
    <p>Your code should look like this:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/HighlightedCode.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>Save it. In the top Eclipse menu bar (not the O'Reilly tab bar) choose <b>File | Save</b> or click the <b>Save</b> 
      icon at the top of the screen: <img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/icon_save.png"> (we'll show that 
      icon from now on when we want you to save a file).</p>
      
    <p>Now choose <b>Run | Run</b> from the top menu bar (if you don't see this 
      menu choice, click in hello_world.py in the Editor Window again). You can 
      also click the run icon: <img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/icon_run.png">. 
      From now on, when we want you to save AND run a program, 
      we'll show that icon. The first time you run a program, you'll see this prompt:</p>
    
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/RunAsPythonRun.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>Select <b>Python Run</b>. If you entered the code correctly, you'll see that the workspace 
      switches to the Console view and displays the output from your very first Python program:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/Program1Results.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>Congratulations! You're officially a Python programmer! Of course this program isn't very complex, 
      but the interpreter has done the calculation you asked it to do. Pat yourself 
      on the back! You're off to a strong start. Experiment with other calculations. 
      You can probably work out how to save modified programs under different names (Hint: <b>File | 
        Save As</b>).</p>
    
  </div></div>
  <a name="s_02"></a><div id="s_02"><div class="subheading">The Interactive Interpreter</div><div class="subheadingText">
      
    <p>In Python you can run the interpreter in interactive
      mode when you want to try things out, and see results printed right away. That instant feedback is
      really handy when you're learning a new language.</p>
      
    <p>Eclipse gives you access to interactive Python consoles.</p> 
      
    <p>Select the <b>Console</b> tab in the workspace window, and click the down arrow to the right of the 
      <b>Open Console</b> icon:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/OpenConsoleSelectionIcon.gif"></div><p></p>
    
    <p>Select <b>Pydev Console</b> from the pull-down menu:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/ConsoleMenuPyDev.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>Select a Python console:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/PyDevConsoleSelect.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>A new console appears, with the interactive prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>. The console is ready 
      for your input:</p>
      
    <p></p><div class="c"><img src="./Introduction to Eclipse_files/PyDevConsole1.png"></div><p></p>
      
    <p>If you enter one of the lines from the program you just ran, the output
      will appear in the console window. This interactive interpreter window allows you to enter
      both statements and expressions (we'll cover those in detail later).
      Statements are executed pretty much as if they were part of a program; the
      expressions are evaluated and the resulting value is
      printed (as long as you're in interactive mode).</p>
    
    <p>Type the code in <ins>blue</ins> below in the PyDev Console window. <b>(When we say
      TYPE the code, do it. It's good for you!)</b> The interpreter prints a result 
      for each expression. (You'll see a 
      different prompt after the fourth line. We'll talk about that in a minute):</p>

<div class="interactiveBox"><div class="interactiveTitle">CODE TO TYPE: </div><div class="interactive"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>"hello" + " world"</ins>
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>'hello' + ' world'</ins>
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>"""hello""" + ''' world'''</ins>
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; <ins>"""hello 
... world"""</ins>
'hello\nworld'
</pre></div></div>
      
    <p>So, what happened here? The first three lines are all examples of 
      <i>string concatenation</i>â€” a second string is appended to the first, giving a longer
      string as a result. Strings can have either single (') or double (") quotation marks around
      them, and either one quotation mark or three at the beginning and end of the
      string. Use exactly the same combination at both ends.</p>
      
    <p>The last expression, running over lines 4 and 5 of the input, shows an important difference
      between the one-quotation mark and the three-quotation mark forms. A string given in one-quotation mark form <i>must</i> 
      begin and end on the same line. Three-quotation mark strings can spread across more than one line.</p>
      
    <p>The fourth example actually does extend across two lines, so the interpreter
      changed its prompt from <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> to <b>...</b> (ellipses) after you entered the first line. Those ellipses 
      let you know that you've got an incomplete statement or expression in your code. When
      you completed the string with the second line of input, the interpreter then printed the
      value of the two-line expression. You can see that the line feed between <b>hello</b> and
      <b>world</b> is represented by <b>\n</b>, which is known in Python as a string <i>escape
      sequence</i>.</p>
